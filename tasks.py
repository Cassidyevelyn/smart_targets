# SMART Targets.

# Task 1:
# Create a variable and assign it the value of “hello”
# Use an if statement to check if the variable is equal to hello, and if it is print”Hey there!”

greeting = "hello"
if greeting == "hello":
    print("Hey there!")

# Create a dictionary with the keys of “brand” with the value of “nike” and the key of “type” and the value of “shoe”.
# Access and print out the value held under type from the dictionary just created
shoe_dictionary = {"brand": "nike", "type": "shoe"}
print(shoe_dictionary["type"])
#-------------------------------------------------------


# Task 2:
# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))
# Using a loop add two to each number
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] += 2

# Using a loop print out each number in the list
for number in numbers:
    print(number)


# Task 3:
# Create a person class with the properties of  name (str), wallet (int). And a  shopping list (List) that starts off empty
# Write  methods to add and remove items from the shopping list
# Write a method called `print_shopping_list` to print out each item in the shopping list (using a loop)
# Task 4:
# Create an instance of the person class
# Add a string of “banana” to the shopping list of that person
# Add a string of “soap” to the shopping list of that person
# Print out the ‘name’ property of the person
# Call the person’s method to print out the shopping list.
# Task 5 :
# Try the lab with scaffold as a homework
greeting = "hello"
if greeting == "hello":
    print("Hey there!")
